# Qt-File-Explorer
Using C++ and Qt 6, I created a desktop File Explorer program that lets users view and manage files using a graphical user interface. For an effective file system representation, the project makes use of Qt's Model–View architecture using QFileSystemModel. It facilitates the creation, deletion, renaming, copying, cutting, and pasting of files etc.
